## Run and Play:
- Download the file in a directory
- Use terminal to visit that directory
- Build the main.go file into binary form using the `go build` command
- Run the main.go file with `go run main.go` command
- Open your browser with `localhost:8080`
- Add `/` to see the root functionality
- Add `/form.html` to interact with the form

Thank you!
